// StudentsController — CARRIED FORWARD FROM SESSION 17 (Rule 39)
// ITI Summer Training | Web Development Using .NET | Morning Group
// Session 18 — Views
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING IN THIS FILE CHANGES TODAY. Not one line.
//
//    That is the single most important fact about Session 18, and it is
//    worth saying before anything else: every page you are about to
//    rebuild, restyle, split apart and extend is driven by exactly the
//    controller you already have. Today happens entirely on the other
//    side of `return View(...)`.
//
// ✅ SESSION 17 FINISHED THE CONTROLLER.
//    Session 15 wired up Dependency Injection. Session 16 designed the
//    URLs. Session 17 built the actions, the model binding, the
//    validation and the redirect. All of that is below, done, working.
//
// SEVEN OF THESE ACTIONS END WITH `return View(...)`. Every single one
// of them hands an object to a file none of you have ever opened on
// purpose, and that file turns the object into the HTML a browser
// receives. Today is that file.
//
// ⚠️ SO WHERE ARE TODAY'S TODOs? Not here. All nine of them are in
//    `.cshtml` files and one new `.cs` file under TagHelpers/. See the
//    map at the top of Views/Students/Index.cshtml.
//
// This project is DAY-READY (Rule 39). Press F5 before touching
// anything and the entire site from Sessions 15-17 still works.

        //           1. If id is zero, answer with the helper that means
        //              "there is nothing here" — the same one Details
        //              already uses further down this file.
        //           2. If id is one, answer with the helper that hands
        //              back a piece of plain text rather than a page.
        //              Pass it the sentence: I am plain text, not a page.
        //           3. If id is two, answer with the helper that turns an
        //              object into JSON. Pass it a small anonymous object
        //              with two properties, Message and Id, holding the
        //              text This one is JSON and the value of id.
        //           4. If id is three, answer with the helper that sends
        //              the browser somewhere else entirely, naming the
        //              listing action of this same controller as a string.
        //           5. For anything else, answer with the helper that
        //              renders a page, passing it no model at all.
        //         Every one of those five helpers is a method you inherit
        //         from the Controller base class. You have not added a
        //         single using directive to reach them, and Block 1
        //         explains why that is the whole point of inheriting.

        //           - a piece of text called agent, marked as coming from
        //             a request header, and told which header by name —
        //             the standard one that identifies the browser,
        //             spelled with a hyphen in the middle.

        //         including the student's name into the framework's
        //         one-request-only message bag, and then — instead of
        //         returning a view — return the helper that tells the
        //         BROWSER to go and ask for a different address, naming
        //         the listing action of this controller.
        //         ⚠️ Returning a view here would compile and appear to
        //         work. Block 5 shows exactly what it costs: the user's
        //         address bar still says Create, so pressing F5 re-sends
        //         the form and inserts the student a second time. The
        //         redirect is not tidiness; it is the fix for a real bug.
