// =====================================================================
// StudentsController — SESSION PROJECT (Rule 20/34/35/39/40)
// ITI Summer Training | Web Development Using .NET | Morning Group
// Session 16 — Routing
//
// ⚠️ WE ARE STILL NOT LEARNING CONTROLLERS TODAY.
//    Session 15 borrowed HomeController to PROVE that Dependency
//    Injection had delivered something real. Today we borrow this one
//    for the same kind of reason: a route has to point AT something, and
//    an empty room proves nothing. Session 17 is the session that builds
//    controllers properly — action results, model binding, validation,
//    all of it.
//
// Everything in this file is carried-forward skill (Rule 39): a
// constructor-injected context from Session 15, and EF Core queries from
// Session 14. It is all real, working code, pre-typed, and it compiles
// and runs before a single TODO is done. Not one line of it is today's
// topic.
//
// TODAY'S TOPIC IS THE URL, NOT THE METHOD. Every action below is
// currently reachable only through the default route inherited from
// Session 15 — /Students/Details/3 and friends. By the end of Block 4
// the same methods will answer /students/3, /students/year/2 and
// /students/honours/first, without one line inside them changing.
