// CoursesController — SESSION PROJECT (Style Guide Rule 20/35/39/40)
// ITI Summer Training | Web Development Using .NET | Morning Group
// Session 19 — Block 4: Displaying the Other Direction
//
// A brand-new file, but nothing in it is a brand-new IDEA. Every shape
// here — inject the context, write an async action, query, Include,
// return View(list-or-object) — is something you have written at least
// twice before, in StudentsController. Today proves those shapes were
// never really about Student; they were about "a controller with a
// database behind it," and any entity fits.
//
// Its two views, Views/Courses/Index.cshtml and Details.cshtml, are
// PRE-WRITTEN — Views were Session 18's taught topic, not today's, so
// today's TODOs stay on the C#/LINQ side, same as Rule 26 already
// applied to Session 18's own Instructors views.

        //         id, Including its Instructor, and Including its
        //         Enrollments — then, on that SAME Enrollments include,

        //         other one exists.
        //         Use FirstOrDefaultAsync, and if nothing matches,
        //         return the same "there is nothing here" helper every
        //         other Details action in this project already uses.
