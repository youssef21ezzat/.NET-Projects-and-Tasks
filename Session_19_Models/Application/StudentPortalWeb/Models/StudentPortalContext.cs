// =====================================================================
// StudentPortalContext — SESSION PROJECT (Style Guide Rule 20/35/39/40)
// ITI Summer Training | Web Development Using .NET | Morning Group
// Session 19 — Models: the Many-to-Many Relationship
//
// Student/Course/Instructor and the existing Fluent API are CARRIED
// FORWARD FROM SESSION 14, real and working (Rule 39). Today adds
// Enrollment — the associative entity connecting Student and Course.
//
// ⚠️ THIS PROJECT DOES NOT OWN MIGRATIONS (Rule 38, unchanged since
//    Session 15). Before ANY of today's TODOs here will actually run
//    against a real Enrollments table, the Enrollment entity and its
//    Fluent API config must ALREADY have been migrated for real, from
//    the SESSION 14 CONSOLE PROJECT — see its own TODOs 1-2 and the
//    Instructor Guide's Block 2. This file's job is to describe the
//    SAME shape a second time, in this project's own separately
//    compiled assembly, so THIS project's LINQ queries can see it too.
//    See the 📌 in Block 2 for why one entity has to be typed twice.
