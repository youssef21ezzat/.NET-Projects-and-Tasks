// StudentsController — SESSION PROJECT (Rule 20/34/35/39/40)
// ITI Summer Training | Web Development Using .NET | Morning Group
// Session 17 — Controllers
//
// ✅ TODAY WE ARE FINALLY LEARNING CONTROLLERS.
//    Session 15 borrowed a controller to prove Dependency Injection had
//    delivered something. Session 16 borrowed this one so the routes had
//    somewhere to point. Both times I said "Session 17 builds controllers
//    properly". This is Session 17.
//
// WHAT A CONTROLLER ACTUALLY IS, in one sentence, before you read any
// further: it is an ordinary C# class whose public methods are allowed to
// answer web requests. That is all. The `: Controller` on the line below
// is what makes it "allowed", and Block 1 opens up exactly what that
// inheritance hands you.
//
// The word ACTION means: one of those public methods. Nothing more
// mysterious than that. `Index`, `Details`, `ByYear` and `Honours` below
// are four actions, and they have been answering requests all week.
//
// Everything already in this file is carried-forward, working code
// (Rule 39): constructor injection from Session 15, EF Core queries from
// Session 14, and the four actions Session 16's routes point at. Press F5
// before touching anything and the whole site still works.

        // TODO 1: Write one brand-new action called Demo that takes a
        //         single whole-number parameter named id, and answers
        //         with a DIFFERENT kind of result depending on what it
        //         is handed. Its return type is the same interface every
        //         action in this file already returns — the one that
        //         means "some sort of web answer, I am not saying which
        //         yet". Do not mark it async: it touches no database, so
        //         there is nothing to await, and marking it async anyway
        //         would be a promise the method does not keep.
        //         Inside, in this exact order:
        //           1. If id is zero, answer with the helper that means
        //              "there is nothing here" — the same one Details
        //              already uses further down this file.
        //           2. If id is one, answer with the helper that hands
        //              back a piece of plain text rather than a page.
        //              Pass it the sentence: I am plain text, not a page.
        //           3. If id is two, answer with the helper that turns an
        //              object into JSON. Pass it a small anonymous object
        //              with two properties, Message and Id, holding the
        //              text This one is JSON and the value of id.
        //           4. If id is three, answer with the helper that sends
        //              the browser somewhere else entirely, naming the
        //              listing action of this same controller as a string.
        //           5. For anything else, answer with the helper that
        //              renders a page, passing it no model at all.
        //         Every one of those five helpers is a method you inherit
        //         from the Controller base class. You have not added a
        //         single using directive to reach them, and Block 1
        //         explains why that is the whole point of inheriting.
